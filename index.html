            <h1>Happy Valentine's Day, Sanika!</h1><br>
            Look, I know we said "Valentine's Day is overrated" and all, and you're right, every day with you is a special occasion, but I just need an excuse to show you how much I love you...<br>
            Plus, this is my attempt at an "online love letter", because love letters aren't that common nowadays.<br>
            <br>
            I know I don't text much these days, but it doesn't mean my love for you is reducing. I promise you, we're as strong as ever. I honestly don't like texting in general now, for some reason.<br>
            <br>
            There are some thing I wanna do with you though, like go on those online dates again. You made me love Taylor Swift and One Direction. Fun fact, I was actually planning on singing "Adore you" while playing it on my ukulele, but then my throat got all fucked up, so I had to settle with this. <br>
            <br>
            I still am scared about our future, about what might happen to us. Then I realised, the threat of us breaking apart always lingered around our relationship, since our wild 7th grade days. It didn't stop us then and it's not gonna stop us now, or ever in the future. You don't have to worry about me being insecure and impulsively saying that we should go on a break again. But, if I do, remember that I'll always come back home to you.<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for accepting me with all my flaws. Thank you for making me a better person. I love you.<br><br><br>
